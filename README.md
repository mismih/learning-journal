    Learned topics:
- Stack
- Heap
- Polymorphism
- Recursion
- What an API is
- How the `return` statement works
- What "The Stack" is (stack frame concept)

    Code written:
- Implemented an `if` statement and multiplication/division of two numbers in NASM x86 (Windows)

    Plans for tomorrow:
- Start reading *Programming from the Ground Up* by Jonathan Bartlett
- Write a `for` loop in assembly
- Implement the `strlen` function in assembly
- Start learning the C programming language (memory, data types)
- Read production incident post-mortem reports

    Future plans:
- Learn DevOps (Docker, CI/CD, Cloud â€“ AWS, Azure)
- Unit and integration testing (xUnit, NUnit)
- Profiling and logging (OpenTelemetry, Serilog)
- Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana)
- Working with APIs (Postman)
- HTTP and network protocols
- ASP.NET
- SQL
- Small projects:
  - Tiny shell
  - Unity game (Parts II and III)
- Using `perf` reports and analyzing cache misses
- Working with system calls

    Where I see myself in the future:
- Working as a software engineer (low-level or backend)
- Highly proficient in C, Assembly, C#, .NET, and memory management
- Contributing to the development of complex systems (compilers, OS components, backend services)
- Strong understanding of how computers work at the lowest level
- Experienced with DevOps tools (Docker, CI/CD, monitoring)
- Building personal projects (games, tools, mini OS)
- Confident in debugging, performance analysis, and reading system-level code
