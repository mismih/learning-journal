## About me:
My name is Mihajlo, I’m a 15-year-old programmer from Serbia. Besides coding, I’m passionate about volleyball and deeply involved in music production — creating beats, mixing sounds, and experimenting with different styles. I see myself as someone who loves to push boundaries, both on the court and behind the screen. I am also making a game with my dad, we published the first part on steam (Droid wars duel), the other two parts are still in production.
My ultimate goal is to become a top-tier software engineer, mastering the craft from low-level programming all the way to complex systems and cutting-edge technologies. I’m driven by curiosity, determination, and a hunger to constantly learn and improve. One day, I want my code to make an impact — whether it’s building powerful tools, innovative apps, or inspiring others through technology.

### Future plans:
- DO LEETCODE/NEETCODE DAILY !!!
- Learn DevOps (Docker, CI/CD, Cloud – AWS, Azure)
- Unit and integration testing (xUnit, NUnit)
- Profiling and logging (OpenTelemetry, Serilog)
- Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana)
- Working with APIs (Postman)
- HTTP and network protocols
- ASP.NET
- SQL
- Small projects:
  - Tiny shell
  - Unity game (Parts II and III)
- Using `perf` reports and analyzing cache misses
- Working with system calls

### Where I see myself in the future:
- Working as a software engineer (low-level or backend)
- Highly proficient in C, Assembly, C#, .NET, and memory management
- Contributing to the development of complex systems (compilers, OS components, backend services)
- Strong understanding of how computers work at the lowest level
- Experienced with DevOps tools (Docker, CI/CD, monitoring)
- Building personal projects (games, tools, mini OS)
- Confident in debugging, performance analysis, and reading system-level code
