    Where I see myself in the future:
- Working as a software engineer (low-level or backend)
- Highly proficient in C, Assembly, C#, .NET, and memory management
- Contributing to the development of complex systems (compilers, OS components, backend services)
- Strong understanding of how computers work at the lowest level
- Experienced with DevOps tools (Docker, CI/CD, monitoring)
- Building personal projects (games, tools, mini OS)
- Confident in debugging, performance analysis, and reading system-level code
